SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Microsoft Windows 98(SE)/ME/2000/XP/VI
- should work under Delphi 6 and higher (tested on Delphi 7, Delphi2007 and Delphi 2009) and Lazarus 0.9.26 and higher (Win32 only)


INSTALLATION:
-------------------
1. In your project or when compiling the demo, specify search path to
   Source\KIcon.pas under Project/Options/Directories.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-------------------
CopyToBitmap does not work good in Delphi for 32 bpp images with alpha channel and in some versions of Lazarus.
Reason is errorneous TBitmap implementation.

I expect problems with the LoadFromAssoc... methods, although I’ve tested the methods heavily. 

I have implemented these through the direct access to the registry, because other approach 
(Shell) frustrated me.
