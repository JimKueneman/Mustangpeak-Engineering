The CDI test uses the xmllint utility.  To install that on Windows, see:

Issues:
    
How handle prereqs, like config needed for datagram test?  Use PIP nicely?
Fallback if PIP not present? Eventually need an input form where you can
specify (once) what is present and should be tested.  Or just test it all,
say what's not there, and let that be a record for later?

May 30, 2015:

Working on the TCP protocol.  

For now, "Ethernet" in default.py refers to GridConnect-over-TCP, while "TCP" refers
to the native TCP protocol.
This is being developed in parallel files:
    tcpolcblink.py
    tcpolcbutils.py
    verifyNodeGlobalTcp.py
copied from the CAN versions.

Handling TCP vs CAN at low level (below tests) is hard because you 
want to be able to do format checks...  Probably want to have a way
of doing content checks that's shared across all wire protocols, plus
some wire-protocol specific parts?

-----

Planned tests:

datagram test should test permanent-error-NAK, which doesn't get retransmission.

need to merge in testOverlappingDatagrams.py to allTest

Configuration test:
    Check for reading not-defined space - does what?
    Decode the status bits in address-space-reply messages
